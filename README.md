This project is currently in beta, and uses the Heroku client-side and GitHub Pages server-side rather than EvenNode to host the site. Expect the site to go down sometimes, along with a few other bugs. This project is strictly for archival purposes. We're aware we're using the company that shall not be named's IP, there's no denying that, but we feel it's right to keep the Legacy Video Maker up for archival purposes to show what it was like. If you're gonna DMCA us, please come up with a valid reason to do so before you do it.

If you're looking for Wrapper: Offline, a direct download link for it can be found here. It's encoded in BASE64 so you'll need to decode it. `aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL3VjP2V4cG9ydD1kb3dubG9hZCZpZD0xZzk0ZXJYOUNCalRCeEE1dWN0T2xJd3RnSTVaN1djR3g=`
